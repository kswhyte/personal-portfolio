      <h2>Strengths</h2>
      <p>
        I value my personal growth and evolution. My strengths define how I connect to this value, other people, and the world I live in. At the core of social progress, I a see great need for the users of new technology to participate in the development process with greater awareness of how it effects the way we interact with our surroundings and each other.

      <p class="interest-p">
        Having a deep interest in human consciousness, philosophy, and human behavior, I have come to greatly appreciate a larger focus on each person's <em>strengths</em> as a means to bridge socio-cultural gaps. Gallup's <a href="http://www.strengthsfinder.com/home.aspx" class="hyperlink">StrengthsFinder</a> was founded on 50 years of researching human behavior. Below, you'll see a fairly accurate synopsis of my own aptitude based on these assessments and other insights.

          I love to travel--I have explored over 20 countries, 4 of which I have lived in for at least 4 months (Switzerland, Thailand, India, Australia). Whether it's meeting new people from outside of the country, embarking on a great outdoor adventure, or exploring diverse cultural traditions, I am thrilled to visit new places.

          I am deeply inspirined by exploring new perspectives and can often be found with a camera, capturing experiences, surroundings and beautiful urban or natural landscapes.
          If you don't find me on a bike, in a new country, or with a camera, you can most likely count on me being on the ski slopes.
